# #Challenge 2: Intro to Arguements

Here we learn the format of using an arguement with a command. We've learned that the structure of commands places the command itself first, followed by its arguments. For example, in the phrase, "hello hackers," "hello" acts as the command, with "hackers" serving as the argument.

Also, we learn about the "echo" command. The "echo" command is a straightforward tool that displays whatever text you enter after the prompt.
