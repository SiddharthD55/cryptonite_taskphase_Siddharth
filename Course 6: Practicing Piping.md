# #Challenge 1: Redirecting output

I discovered that the operator `>` is utilized for redirecting command output to a specified file. In this instance, I executed `echo PWN > COLLEGE`, after redirecting to home directory via `cd ~`, which directed the text "PWN" into the file labeled "COLLEGE."

# #Challenge 2: Redirecting more output

To redirect the flag to a file called "myflag," you simply need to run the command `/challenge/run > myflag`. Once that's done, you can display the contents of the flag file by using `cat myflag`.

# #Challenge 3: Appending output

I executed the command `/challenge/run >> /home/hacker/the-flag` to redirect the output in append mode. 

The program welcomed me and confirmed that my stdout was properly directed to the specified file. 

It informed me that it would write the flag in two parts: the first part directly to the file and the second part to stdout.

Since I used append mode, the second part was added to the first, resulting in the complete flag. 

I then used `cat /home/hacker/the-flag` to display the entire flag.

# #Challenge 4: Redirecting errors

A File Descriptor (FD) is a numerical identifier used to represent a communication channel in Linux.

We already know about three key file descriptors:

- **FD 0**: Standard Input
- **FD 1**: Standard Output
- **FD 2**: Standard Error

I started by navigating to my home directory with the command `cd ~`. Then, I ran the command `/challenge/run > myflag 2> instructions` to redirect the output and error messages. 

After executing it, I checked the contents of `myflag` using `cat myflag`, which displayed the message: `[FLAG] Here is your flag`. 

This confirmed that I successfully captured the flag in the designated file.

# #Challenge 5: Redirecting input

We can redirect input to programs using the `<` operator.

First, we write the word "COLLEGE" into a file called "PWN." 

Next, we redirect the contents of "PWN" to `/challenge/run` using the command `/challenge/run < PWN`.

# #Challenge 6: Grepping stored results

For this task, we needed to redirect the output of `/challenge/run` to the file `/tmp/data.txt` using the command `/challenge/run > /tmp/data.txt`. 

Afterwards, to search for the flag, we simply ran `grep pwn.college /tmp/data.txt`.

# #Challenge 7: Grepping live output

We learned about the pipe operator `|`. Here we needed to find the flag among a large amount of text. To do this, we used the pipe operator along with our standard `grep` command. The command was `/challenge/run pwn.college-pwn.college | grep pwn.college`.

**pwn.college{wn0EThV8FzQaggoNOKdtBiy1_ye.dlTM4QDLxETO0czW}**

# #Challenge 8: Grepping errors

The `>` operator is used to redirect a specified file descriptor to a file, while `2>` is employed to redirect fd 2, which corresponds to standard error. 

On the other hand, the `|` operator only redirects standard output to another program, and there is no form like `2|` for redirecting standard error â€” it exclusively handles standard output.

We combine stderr and stdout using the command `/challenge/run 2>&1`. 

Normally, a pipe command only passes stdout to the next step, but by combining them, we can then use a `grep` command. 

The final command is `/challenge/run 2>&1 | grep pwn.college`.

# #Challenge 9: Duplicating piped data with tee

Here we need to capture the output of `/challenge/pwn` and view it using the `cat` command. We'll start with the command `/challenge/pwn | tee challenge | /challenge/college`.

After running this, we can check the contents of the `challenge` file with `cat challenge`, which reveals a secret code and the format required for using it. Basically,  `--secret [SECRET_ARG] SECRET_ARG should be "Mxv2HK25"`.

Once we correctly apply the secret code, we will receive the flag.

# #Challenge 10: Writing to multiple programs

To apply two substitutions using `tee`, you can use the following command: `/challenge/hack | tee >( /challenge/the ) >( /challenge/planet )`.

The command `/challenge/hack | tee >( /challenge/the ) >( /challenge/planet )` takes the output of `/challenge/hack` and simultaneously sends it to two different processes. 

The `tee` command splits the output so that it can be processed by both `/challenge/the` and `/challenge/planet` concurrently, allowing you to perform multiple substitutions or transformations on the same input stream. 

This is useful for handling data in parallel without needing to run the initial command multiple times.

Note :- The secret data must be sent directly and simultaneously to both /challenge/the and /challenge/planet. Avoid copying and pasting, as it changes too quickly.

# #Challenge 11: Split-piping stderr and stdout

The command `/challenge/hack > >( /challenge/planet ) 2> >( /challenge/the )` redirects the output of `/challenge/hack` to `/challenge/planet` while sending any error messages to `/challenge/the`. 

The standard output (`stdout`) from `/challenge/hack` is sent to `/challenge/planet`, while any error output (`stderr`) is directed to `/challenge/the`, allowing for separate handling of successful results and errors.
