# #Challenge 1: Printing Variables

In this challenge , we cannot read the flag just by running `/challenge/flag`. This is because the flag is put into a variable named `FLAG`.

I used the command `echo $FLAG` to print the flag stored in the FLAG variable in my shell. When I executed this command, it displayed the flag.

This shows how to access and display the value of an environment variable in a shell.
